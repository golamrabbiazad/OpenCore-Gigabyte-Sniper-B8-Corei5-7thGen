## OpenCore Development

So, what is OpenCore?

> OpenCore is completely new way to boot up the macOS system. It is blazingly fast to boot and kind of work like a native mac.

***And It is highly not recommended for beginners or new to  hackintosh because lot of things setup, configure plist file manually.  Well if you want to try it out make sure backup your EFI files. Then you can follow lot of youtube tutorials step by step to make your system  up.\***

To setup vanilla opencore follow the guide: [OpenCore Guide](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/)
